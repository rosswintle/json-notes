    <h2>About JSON Notes</h2>
    <p>JSON Notes is a simple application that runs in your browser for
    taking notes in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
    (a simple text formatting language that easily converts to HTML).</p>
    <p><strong>It's completely private!</strong> Notes are saved to a local file on your computer
        that no one else can see. The <em>only</em> thing you should know is that I
        use cookie-free, privacy-compliant <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/SVE71E">Fathom Analytics</a>
        to track visits because I'm curious how you found this little project.
    </p>
    <p><strong>It's competely free!!</strong> As in beer AND as in speech. Use it,
    <a href="https://ko-fi.com/magicroundabout">buy me a coffee</a>
    <p>If you like it though, or just say "hello" or "thank you". Find me <a href="https://rw.omg.lol">here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>It's completely untrustworthy!</strong> Don't use it! I mostly hacked it together
    in about three hours one weekend. It _could_ lose all your notes at a moments
    notice. So really don't use it for anything critical. (Although, to be honest,
    I use it for my own notes. So I want it to _not_ do anything bad. If that makes
    you feel better.)</p>
    <p><strong>There is no save button!!</strong> It automatically saves your notes
    every few seconds.</p>
    <p><strong>It's not mobile friendly.</strong> Yet. Maybe one day. But anyway...</p>
    <p><strong>It only works in Chrome/Edge/Arc/Brave/Chromium</strong>. I'll get
    shit for this. But Chrome has a decent FileSystem API that lets me write files to
    disk without too much hassle. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I hate that too!</p>
